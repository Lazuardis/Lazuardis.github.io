  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract     = {One of many factors that affecting port infrastructure performance is the quality of services delivered; which is defined by three aspects:availability, speed, and realibility of services. In PT Terminal Teluk Lamong, the existing operational was deemed inefficient, indicated by customer complaints specifically in speed of services within receiving/delivery process. Truck turnaround time is one of performance indicators for measuring efficiency level of receiving/delivery activity. It is defined as the length of time required for a customer truck to complete the entire process in the receiving/delivery activities. Historical data showed that there is a large number of customer’s trucks with high value of truck turnaround time, even greater than the maximum standard set. With discrete event simulation methodology, operational activities can be mapped in details considering the behaviour and interactions among every entity, process, procedure and regulation, and all of parameters that relevant in the system. This understanding of the observed system provides information on how the system components and the changes in the values affect the system’s performance indicators. From this understanding, some improvement plans are then proposed. In PT Terminal Teluk Lamong, it is found that the high truck turnaround time is caused by several aspects such as the dispersion of trucks arrival pattern which is centered in some point of time. This, finally has caused a significant congestion. Several proposed improvement alternatives include adding resources, truck arrival scheduling, and some changes in policy regarding the truck regulation. These alternatives of improvement are then simulated in scenarios to investigate their impact on the system performance indicators. Experiments with the simulation model under different scenarios showed that the best result can be produced by combining the addition of 4 International ASC Blocks and 3 Domestic ASC Blocks while employing truck arrival scheduling that considers peak hours.},
